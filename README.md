# React Apollo Universal

This repo experiments with the latest bike shed technologies on the market today.

**Includes:**
- React
- GraphQL
- Apollo
- Styled-Components
- React-Router
- React-Intl
- Webpack
- Workbox
- TypeScript

We take advantage of server-side rendering when we can using React, React-Router, Apollo, and Styled-Components on the server so our first paint is extremely fast. Afterwards we rehydrate on the client with data, event listeners, lifecycle hooks, etc which is for the most part handled by React.
